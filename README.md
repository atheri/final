This site is a cross between reddit and a regular forum

There are 3 components to this: Boards, Posts, and Comments.

Boards are collections of posts. When a user wants to post something they must first select a board to post to.

A post consists of a title and text content.

Comments can be applied to individual posts.

Users can vote on posts (up/down) which affects the post overall score.

Each board displays all the posts on that board in descending score order. So user votes affect the order in which the posts are displayed.

Anything a User creates (board/post/comment) can be edited / deleted by only the user that created it.

The homepage displays all posts from all boards sorted by their score.

If a user is logged in they can create new boards/posts/comments as well as create posts/comments on existing boards/posts.

If you are not logged in you can only view everything on the site (boards/posts/comments)

== Screen Shots ==

[1] Front Page: User not signed in. Can't make new boards or upvote/downvote posts.

[2] Front Page: User signed in. Can upvote/downvote now, create a new board, delete posts that they made. A little alert pops up in the top that you can close with the x. 

[3] Board View: This is little at the Chemistry Jokes board, which shows all posts that are part of this particular board. Board name and short description on the right.

[4] Board View: This is a board called default. This user created the board so they can edit or delete it on the right. They can also delete the first post since they are the one who posted it.

[5] Post View: This is a particular post in a board. The title is at the top, followed by who submitted, the board name, and then the actual content of the post. Users can comment below on the post. As with everything else, users can delete their own comments.

[6] New Board: This is the new board creation form. Most of my forms look like this as I ran out of time to make them better. I added a text_area for fields that would probably contain more text, and added some bootstrap buttons.
